Methodologies </h1>
<p class="western c10" lang="en-GB"> Different kinds
of methods: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="western c20" lang="en-GB"> <span class="c18"><strong>Adaptive
methods</strong></span> <span class="c15">focus
on
adapting
quickly
to changing realities.</span> <span class="c18"><strong>When
the
needs of a project change, an</strong></span> <span class="c18"><strong>adaptive
team</strong></span> <span class="c18"><strong>changes as well</strong></span><span
 class="c15">.</span> </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="western c20" lang="en-GB"> <span class="c18"><strong>Predictive
methods</strong></span><span class="c15">.
Predictive
teams

  <li>
    <p class="western c20" lang="en-GB"> <span class="c18"><strong>Formal
method</strong></span> <span class="c15">are
heavily
dependent
on
a tool driven approach, and may be combined with
other development approaches. Some provers do not easily scale</span> </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="western c7" lang="en-GB"> Waterfall
Model </h2>
<p class="western c10" lang="en-GB"> This is a group
of software development well-defined phases starting with: </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p class="western c20" lang="en-GB"> <span class="c15">the</span> <span
 class="c18"><strong>Analysis of
Requirement</strong></span> <span class="c15">following with</span> </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="western c20" lang="en-GB"> <span class="c15">the</span> <span

  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="western c20" lang="en-GB"> <span class="c18"><strong>Implementation</strong></span>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="western c20" lang="en-GB"> <span class="c18"><strong>Testing</strong></span>
    <span class="c15">(or</span> <span class="c18"><strong>Quality
Assurance</strong></span><span class="c15">)</span> </p>

  <li>
    <p class="western c20" lang="en-GB"> <span class="c18"><strong>Installation</strong></span>

    <p class="western c20" lang="en-GB"> <span class="c15">future</span>
    <span class="c18"><strong>Maintenance</strong></span> </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p class="western c10" lang="en-GB"> In this model
late changes can be quite costly to implement. An important point is
that you cannot expect users to be fully aware of what they require and
this classic methodologies do not take this into consideration, and
might thus incur important cost, because newly discovered or determined
requirements can invalidate a previous design. </p>
<p class="western c10" lang="en-GB"> Finally,
it&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s difficult to predict where difficulties will occur; </p>
<h2 class="western c7" lang="en-GB"> Agile
Model </h2>
<p class="western c16" lang="en-GB"> <span class="c15">Agile
software
development
is
a group of software development methodologies</span>
<span class="c18"><strong>based on</strong></span> <span class="c18"><strong>iterative</strong></span><span
 class="c18"><strong>and</strong></span> <span class="c18"><strong>incremental</strong></span><span
 class="c18"><strong>development</strong></span><span class="c15">,
where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between</span>
<span class="c18"><strong>self-organizing</strong></span><span
 class="c15">,</span> <span class="c18"><strong>cross-functional</strong></span><span
 class="c15">teams.</span> </p>
<p class="western c16" lang="en-GB"> <span class="c15">Most
agile
methods
share
other iterative and incremental development
methods' emphasis on</span> <span class="c18"><strong>building
releasable software in short time periods</strong></span><span
 class="c15">.</span> </p>
<p class="western c16" lang="en-GB"> <span class="c15">Agile
development
differs
from
other development models: in this model,</span>
<span class="c18"><strong>time periods are measured in weeks</strong></span><span
 class="c15">rather than months and work is performed in a highly
collaborative manner. Most agile methods also differ by treating their
time period as a timebox.</span> </p>
<p class="western c16" lang="en-GB"> <span class="c15">There
are
many
specific</span> <span class="c18"><strong>agile development
methods</strong></span><span class="c15">. Most</span> <span
 class="c18"><strong>promote development, teamwork, collaboration,</strong></span><span
 class="c15">and</span> <span class="c18"><strong>process adaptability</strong></span><span
 class="c15">throughout the</span> <span class="c18"><strong>life-cycle
of
the
project</strong></span><span class="c15">.</span> </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="western c20" lang="en-GB"> <span class="c18"><strong>Specific
tools</strong></span> <span class="c15">and
techniques
such
as</span> <span class="c18"><strong>continuous
integration</strong></span><span class="c15">,</span> <span class="c18"><strong>automated
or
xUnit
test</strong></span><span class="c15">,</span> <span class="c18"><strong>pair
programming</strong></span><span class="c15">,</span> <span class="c18"><strong>test
driven
development</strong></span><span class="c15">,</span> <span class="c18"><strong>design
patterns</strong></span><span class="c15">,</span> <span class="c18"><strong>domain-driven
design</strong></span><span class="c15">,</span> <span class="c18"><strong>code
refactoring</strong></span> <span class="c15">and other techniques are
often used to</span> <span class="c18"><strong>improve quality and
enhance project agility</strong></span><span class="c15">.</span> </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="western c16" lang="en-GB"> <span class="c15">Agile
method
is
not
cowboy coding. In fact,</span> <span class="c18"><strong>Agile
teams follow clearly defined, even rigid processes and controls</strong></span><span
 class="c15">(e.g.,</span> <span class="c18"><strong>deadlines for
completion of coding/testing</strong></span><span class="c15">);</span>
