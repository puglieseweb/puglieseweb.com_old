<h3>What is MiFID? </h3>
<p>The&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="gergon">Markets in
Financial Instruments Directive</span>&nbsp; is a <em>European Union
law</em> that provides harmonised regulation for <strong>investment
services</strong> across the<em> 30 member</em> states of the&nbsp;<a

 title="European Economic Area"
 style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(6, 69, 173); background-image: none;">European

Area</a>&nbsp;(the 27 Member States of the&nbsp;<a

 title="European Union"
 style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(6, 69, 173); background-image: none;">European
Union</a>&nbsp;plus Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein). </p>
<p>The main objectives of the Directive are to <em>increase competition</em>
and <em>consumer protection</em> in <strong>investment services</strong>.<br>

<h3 class="western c11" lang="en-GB"> What do
Commercial banks do?</h3>
<p>A <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="gergon">commercial bank</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="underline">takes deposits for
checking and savings accounts from consumers</span> while an investment
bank does not.</p>
<p>Into a commercial bank we<span style="font-weight: bold;"
 class="gergon"> deposit</span> money, and the bank <span
 style="font-weight: bold;" class="gergon">loans</span> that money to
consumers and companies in need of capital (cash).<br>
</p>
<p>The commercial bank generates a <span style="font-weight: bold;"
 class="gergon">profit</span> by paying <span
 style="font-weight: bold;" class="gergon">depositors</span> a lower
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="gergon">interest rate</span>
than the bank charges on loans.<br>
</p>
<p>Loans from commercial banks are structured as private legally
binding contracts between two parties - the bank and you (or the bank
and a company)</p>
<br>
<h3 style="margin: 15px 0px;">Investment banks (I-bank)?<br>
</h3>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px;">An <span style="font-weight: bold;"
 class="gergon">investment bank</span> does not have an
inventory of <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="gergon">cash
deposits</span> to lend as a commercial bank does. In
essence, an investment bank acts as <span style="font-weight: bold;"
 class="underline">an intermediary, and matches sellers of <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock">stocks</a> and
bonds with buyers of stocks and bonds</span>.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px;">&nbsp;If a company needs capital, it may
get a loan from a bank, or it may ask an investment bank to sell equity
or debt (stocks or bonds)<br>
</p>
<p>I-bank must spend considerable time finding investors in order to
obtain capital for its client. (Note that as investment banks are
increasingly seeking to become "one-stop" financing sources, many
I-banks have set aside billions of dollars of their own capital that
they can use to loan to clients directly.)</p>
<h3>Stocks</h3>
<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="gergon">capital stock</span>
(or just stock) of a business entity represents the
<strong style="font-weight: bold;">original capital</strong><span
 style="font-weight: bold;" class="underline"> paid into or invested in
the business by its founders</span>. <br>
</p>
<p>It serves as a <strong>security for the creditors</strong> of a
business since it <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="underline">cannot
be
withdrawn
to
the
detriment of the creditors</span>.</p>
<p>Stock is distinct from
the <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="gergon">property</span>
and the <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="gergon">assets</span>
of a business which may fluctuate in
quantity and value.</p>

synonym
for&nbsp;<i>shares</i>.</p>

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>A security is generally a fungible, negotiable <span
 style="font-weight: bold;" class="gergon">financial instrument</span>
representing <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="gergon">financial
value</span>.</p>
<p>Securities are broadly categorized into</p>
<ul>
  <li> <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="gergon">debt securities</span>
(such as <strong>banknotes, </strong><strong>bonds</strong> and <strong>debentures</strong>)
and


    <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="gergon">equity</span>
securities, e.g., common <span style="font-weight: bold;"
 class="gergon">stocks; </span>and <span style="font-weight: bold;"
 class="gergon">derivative contracts</span>, such as forwards, futures,
options and swaps. The company or other entity issuing the security is
called the <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="gergon">issuer</span>.
A
country's
regulatory
structure determines what qualifies as a
security.</li>
</ul>
<p>Securities may be represented by a <span style="font-weight: bold;"
 class="gergon">certificate</span> or, more typically,
"non-certificated", that is in electronic or "book entry" only form.
Certificates may be bearer, meaning they entitle the holder to rights
under the security merely by holding the security, or registered,
meaning they entitle the holder to rights only if he or she appears on
a security register maintained by the issuer or an intermediary. They
include shares of corporate stock or mutual funds, bonds issued by
corporations or governmental agencies, stock options or other options,
limited partnership units, and various other formal investment
instruments that are negotiable and fungible.</p>
<h3>Bond</h3>
<p>In&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"
 title="Finance"
 style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(6, 69, 173); background-image: none;">finance</a>,
a&nbsp;bond&nbsp;is
a
debt&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_%28finance%29"
 title="Security (finance)"
 style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(6, 69, 173); background-image: none;">security</a>,
in
which
the
authorized issuer owes the holders a debt and, depending
on the terms of the bond, is obliged to pay<a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest" title="Interest"
 style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(6, 69, 173); background-image: none;">interest</a>&nbsp;(the&nbsp;<a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon_%28bond%29"
 title="Coupon (bond)"
 style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(6, 69, 173); background-image: none;">coupon</a>)
to
use
and/or
to repay the principal at a later date, termed&nbsp;<a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maturity_%28finance%29"
 title="Maturity (finance)"
 style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(6, 69, 173); background-image: none;">maturity</a>.
<br>
</p>
<p>A bond is a formal contract to repay borrowed money with interest at
fixed intervals</p>
<p>Thus a bond is like a loan: the issuer is the borrower (debtor), the
holder is the lender (creditor), and the coupon is the interest. Bonds
provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term
investments, or, in the case of government bonds, to finance current
expenditure. Certificates of deposit (CDs) or commercial paper are
considered to be money market instruments and not bonds.</p>
<p>Bonds and stocks are both securities, but the major difference
between the two is that (capital) stockholders have an equity stake in
the company (i.e., they are owners), whereas bondholders have a
creditor stake in the company (i.e., they are lenders). Another
difference is that bonds usually have a defined term, or maturity,
after which the bond is redeemed, whereas stocks may be outstanding
indefinitely. An exception is a consol bond, which is a perpetuity
(i.e., bond with no maturity).</p>
<h3 class="western c11" lang="en-GB">Financial
instrument</h3>
<p>A&nbsp;<span class="gergon">financial instrument&nbsp;</span>is a

<h3>Derivative<br>
</h3>
<p>Derivative is an agreement between two parties that is
contingent on a future outcome of the underlying.
</p>
<p>A derivative is a<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="gergon">financial
instrument
</span>- or more simply, an<em> agreement between
two people
or two parties</em> - that has a value <strong>determined by the price
of the </strong><span class="gergon">underlying </span>(something
else)
</p>
<p>It is a <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="underline">financial
contract</span> with a
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="gergon">value</span> linked to
the <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="underline">expected future
price</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">movements</span> of the
asset it is
linked to - such as a share or a currency. <br>
</p>
<p>There are many kinds of
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="gergon">derivatives, </span>with
the
most
notable
being <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>swaps, <br>
  </li>
  <li>futures, and <br>
  </li>
  <li>options. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>However, since a <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="gergon">derivative</span>
can be placed on any sort of <span style="font-weight: bold;"
 class="gergon">security, </span>the
scope of all derivatives possible is nearly endless. <br>

<h3 class="western c11" lang="en-GB">What

<p>In
